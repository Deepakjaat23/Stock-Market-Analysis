# 📈 Stock Market Analysis using Python & Power BI

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and visualization of stock market data using Python for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and forecasting, combined with a multi-page Power BI dashboard for business intelligence and insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to explore, analyze, and forecast stock price trends of top companies using real-world financial data. This project integrates:

- Python for data handling and model building
- Power BI for interactive and visually rich dashboards
- A combination of statistical and machine learning models for time series forecasting

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI report consists of **6 interactive pages** featuring:

1. **Overview Dashboard** – KPIs, company stock summaries, market cap trends  
2. **Time Series Trends** – Closing price trends, moving averages, rolling volatility  
3. **Volume Analysis** – Volume-price relationship and volume movement heatmaps  
4. **Forecasting** – Comparison of ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet forecast results  
5. **Relative Strength Analysis** – Strength of company stock vs. benchmark  
6. **Simulation & Trading Signals** – Monte Carlo simulation and pairs trading signals
